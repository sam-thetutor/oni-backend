# Wallet Funding Guide

## Overview

The wallet funding feature automatically sends 0.01 XFI to new users when they create a wallet, ensuring their wallet is activated and ready to use.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Wallet Funding Configuration
FUNDING_PRIVATE_KEY=d0e9117cf353f4895f7a0280b5dab7fd88c19202c43e03be8aefca0c89f7c9d5
FUNDING_AMOUNT=0.01
```

### Funding Wallet Details

- **Address**: `0x85A4b09fb0788f1C549a68dC2EdAe3F97aeb5Dd7`
- **Current Balance**: ~60.125 XFI
- **Funding Amount**: 0.01 XFI per new user
- **Capacity**: Can fund ~6,012 new wallets

## How It Works

1. **User Creation**: When a new user creates an account
2. **Wallet Generation**: A new wallet is generated for the user
3. **Automatic Funding**: 0.01 XFI is automatically sent to the new wallet
4. **Activation**: The wallet is immediately activated and ready to use

}
```

```

## Safety Features

- **Balance Check**: Verifies funding wallet has sufficient balance before sending
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of funding failures
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Non-blocking**: Funding failures don't prevent user creation

## Monitoring

Check the server logs for funding-related messages:

```
ðŸŽ‰ New user created, funding wallet: 0x...
ðŸ’° Funding new wallet: 0x...
ðŸ“Š Amount: 0.01 XFI
âœ… Wallet funded successfully! Transaction: 0x...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Balance**: Add more XFI to the funding wallet
2. **Private Key Error**: Ensure the private key is properly formatted
3. **Network Issues**: Check RPC connection and gas fees

### Funding Wallet Management

To add funds to the funding wallet, send XFI to:
`0x85A4b09fb0788f1C549a68dC2EdAe3F97aeb5Dd7`
